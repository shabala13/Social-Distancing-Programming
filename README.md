## Motivation and Description
Due to the current pandemic circumnavigating the globe, essential items such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, face masks, and Nintendo Switches are hot commodities for consumers. Our product will allow users to find these essential items without having to go to visit multiple stores to view their stock. 

The where’s@ app is a user-driven product locating service that helps people in the community locate requested items in stores near them. Users who enter a store and see specific products can take a picture and upload a listing to the service. Users can then search for the item in where’s@ and find a list of the closest stores with that item in stock, as well as a picture of the item for verification.

## Requirements
