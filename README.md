## Motivation and Description
Due to the current pandemic circumnavigating the globe, essential items such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, face masks, and Nintendo Switches are hot commodities for consumers. Our product will allow users to find these essential items without having to go to visit multiple stores to view their stock. 

The where’s@ app is a user-driven product locating service that helps people in the community locate requested items in stores near them. Users who enter a store and see specific products can take a picture and upload a listing to the service. Users can then search for the item in where’s@ and find a list of the closest stores with that item in stock, as well as a picture of the item for verification.

## Requirements
The phone this application runs on must have an up-to-date version of Google Play Services. For some emulators, the version of Google Play Services does not get updated, so the application might not run properly. The application will run properly when emulating the following phone types: Pixel 3a, Pixel 3, Pixel 2, Pixel, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 5.

## Usage
### Login
Our application requires a login, so either create a new account using the "Create Account" button on the main activity, or login using the following credentials:

- Email: test@gmail.com
- Password: password

### Home Page
The home page displays a search bar with the top ten most searched items underneath it. From this page, the user can navigate to their profile page (by using the menu bar), create a new search, or search an existing product. If the user clicks on an item on the top ten most searched items list, it will take them to the product page for that item.
